      <h1>Roborovsky</h1>
      <p>Roborovski hamsters (Phodopus roborovskii;
      formerly Cricetulus bedfordiae) also known as desert
      hamsters or Robos are the smallest of three species of
      hamster in the genus Phodopus, averaging under 2 centimetres
      (0.8 in) at birth and 4.5–5 centimetres (1.8–2.0 in) and 20–25
      grams (0.71–0.88 oz) during adulthood.[2] Distinguishing characteristics
      of the Roborovskis are eyebrow-like white spots and the lack of any dorsal
      stripe (found on the other members of the Phodopus genus). The average lifespan
      for the Roborovski hamster is three years, though this is dependent on living conditions
      (extremes being four years in captivity and two in the wild).[citation needed] Roborovskis
      are known for their speed and have been said to run an equivalent of four human marathons each night on average.[3]</p>
